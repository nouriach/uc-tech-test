DIRECTIONS

1. Visit the User Conversion homepage: https://www.userconversion.com
2. Open the console
3. Paste JavaScript code into the console and hit enter
4. The homepage will display the update code and functionaility
5. If desired, CSS can be view via the style.css file

---------------------------------------------

BRIEF

In this task you are to write a script that creates a new component on the User Conversion website. When creating this task you should write your JavaScript in the browser console. Don’t worry though, this isn’t how we normally develop tests at User Conversion, it’s just to keep things simple for now. Internally we have our own workflow which allows us to still use our favourite code editors, tools and technologies when creating A/B tests.

For your CSS you can either include it in your JS or provide it separately, it’s up to you. You should build this in such a way that the content is dynamic and always reflects the latest blog posts shown on the /ideas page (even when a new post is created).
